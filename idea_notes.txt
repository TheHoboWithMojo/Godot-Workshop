We’ve been developing a system for adjusting in-game stats, 
including Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, Luck, Kindness, and Cruelty. 

Each stat has a base value and is influenced by other stats via range-based constants. 
The relationships between stats are controlled using piecewise functions, 
allowing for adjustable coefficients for each interaction.

We also implemented an exponential system for Cruelty, 
where the higher the stat, the easier it becomes to increase it, 
represented by an exponential growth function. 
This makes cruelty easier to improve as it increases, 
using constants to control the rate of this effect.

The goal is to create a system that’s highly configurable, 
allowing constants to be tweaked and dynamic relationships to be established. 
These adjustments influence the stats in meaningful ways, 
enabling complex interactions between them, such as Cruelty and Kindness counteracting each other.
